/**
 * Huan(202108): I want to `declare namespace puppet {...}`
 *  but it seemss the `export * from '../out/...js` is not working
 *
 * So I export them on the top level,
 *  then import them in another `puppet.js` file
 *  with the `puppet` namespace
 *
 * This is because the ESM module system need to do the following things
 *  when import a CJS module:
 *
 *  ```ts
 *  import pkg from './cjs-pkg'
 *  const puppet = pkg['puppet']
 *  ```
